According to the docs:
You need to include the namespace for Docker Hub to associate it with your account.
The namespace is the same as your Docker Hub account name.
You need to rename the image to YOUR_DOCKERHUB_NAME/docker-whale.
So, this means you have to tag your image before pushing:
docker tag firstimage YOUR_DOCKERHUB_NAME/firstimage
and then you should be able to push it.
docker push YOUR_DOCKERHUB_NAME/firstimage
Update: see also the answer from provided by Dean Wu. Before pushing, remember to log in from the command line to your docker hub account
docker login
